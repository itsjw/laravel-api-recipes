**Recipes** is an app where amateur chefs can show what food they can make for people to order (think Uber for cooking). People can leave reviews for
a specific recipe made by a a specific chef. Chefs can register recipes they are able to make (well) from a list of recipes; these will be called entr√©es.

In order to run locally:

Must have docker and docker-compose installed.

1. Clone the repository.
2. If no .env files present - CD into the laravel directory and type cp .env.example .env | CD into the laradock directory and type cp env-example .env
3. Using a terminal, cd into the laradock directory and type "docker-compose up -d nginx mysql
4. Using a command line tool, get into the docker container with the laravel app by typing ```docker-compose exec -it laradock_workspace_1 bash```
5. cd into the laravel directory and run ```composer install```
6. Run ```php artisan migrate``` and ```php artisan key:generate``` and if you want to add some mock data ```php artisan db:seed```
7. Check if the site is running by going to localhost:8300
8. Using an API application or your browser address bar, access one of the endpoint addresses of the api (e.g. localhost:8300/api/recipes)
